Log Notes for I2C USI ATtiny85 Demo App for I2C Bootloader Project

ref1: DN_DemoApp2_I2C_ATtiny85.txt


1. Make a directory 'DemoApp2_I2C_ATtiny85' under PortOrgAVR112/Support and 
create an Atmel Studio 7.0 project there.
File > Project > GCC C Executable Project > Name: Demo_I2C_AT85 > Ok
Device Family: ATtiny .. Select ATtiny85 > OK .. build and clean, then save 
and exit from Atmel Studio.
Add a docs directory under DemoApp2_I2C_ATtiny85 and save this file there. 
Create a DN_ file there also.
2. Copy Slave_A2B1.c code into main.c and copy usiTwiSlave.c,.h files and 
add them to the project. Update main.c comments to reflect this project.
3. Set up a multi-switch block and state variable to process commands.
Wire up to Ardiono MEGA for power (+5), gnd, SDA, and SCL. Hook up AVR ISP.
program ATtiny85..uncheck CKDIV8 fuse..program..ok.
4. Get \I2C_Easy\Slave_A2B1\Arduino_A2B1_demo for Arduino test code.
Tools > Board > MEGA 2560. COM8 or as needed. Update code for this demo.
Commands:
	LED ON: 		05 01
	LED OFF:		05 00
	Reset Counter:	01 01
	Read Counter:	04 ->	read one byte.
Arduino code working..commands not..check I2C lines..hmm..all ACKs..check code.
oops, missing a break;, causing a fall through..fix..hah, works..need to 
change LED resistor to 1k from 2.2k for better brightness.

recheck. Arduino demo inop..debug LED ok, then zip..
ADD: systimer.c,.h, mod_led.c,.h
MOD: main.c .. add blink..hmm, DOH, bool uses ! not ~ to invert..fix..ok..
DEBUG: LED toggles at START(4) and OV ISR(6) and loop(2)..not getting OV intr..
toggle STOP(7) no STOP(5)..uninstall and go back to 1.6.13..debug messing up STOP 
detect..fix..ok..working now. Stay with 1.6.13 for now.
Try Bootloader..reprogram AT85 with Bootloader..
