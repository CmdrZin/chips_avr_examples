Reference Design Notes for a 6 RC Servo driver

Target: megaAVR 0-series devices.

General requirements for a RC servo driver.

Duty cycle from 10 ms (10 kHz) to 20 ms (5 kHz).

Resolution <= 8 us.
Most servos do not respond to timing differences of less than 8 us.

Pulse width from 1ms (full CCW) to 2 ms (full CW) with 1.5 ms center.

   <----------------- 20 ms -------------->

Most PWM systems start with the output pin HIGH and use a compare register to set 
it back LOW. This method waists usually half of the compare registers range to 
generate the constant 1ms delay at the beginning of the cycle.

Ideally, a fixed 1ms delay + position delay would allow for the maximum 
resolution of the position delay.
This requires a two stage approach.

Another option is to stop the 8-bit counter at the end of the pulse delay and use 
a different counter to restart it after the 20ms period.

1ms / 8us = 125 to divide up 180 degrees of travel.

This project will atempt to drive six RC servos using TCA in Split Mode and with 
TCB controlling the 20ms period.
Optional: Use RTC as the period timer.
