Design Notes for Button and LED project.


The project uses the ATmega4809 Curiosity Nano Evaluation kit to demonstrate a 
simple project framework. It uses the following support files:
   sysTime     - timer function to provide millis().
   mod_led     - general LED control.
I include these in just about every project I make.

The demo monitors the on-board button and flashes the on-board LED twice when the 
button is pushed.
If the button is held down, the LED flashes three times two seconds after the 
initial double flash.

Setup Timer.
Setup LED IO.
Setup button IO.

Set Enable Blink2 false
Set Enable Blink3 false

Using IF statements:
Loop
  if Trigger Blink2, service Blink2.
  if Trigger Blink3, service Blink3.
  Every 10ms, check button state.
    if (button DOWN and flag), inc count.
    else if button DOWN, set flag and set count=0 and Enable blink2.
    if button UP and count > 3, clear flag.
    if button DOWN and flag and count > 2000, Enable blink3.
endLoop

Using a State Machine:
set state = IDLE
Loop
  Every 10ms, check button state. Will be either UP or DOWN.
  call stateMachine( buttonState )
endLoop

stateMachine( bool buttonState )
  switch(state)
    IDLE: if buttonState is DOWN,
            state = BUTTON_DOWN_1
            set flag
            count = 0
            enable Blink2 
          else state = IDLE.

    BUTTON_DOWN_1:
          if buttonState is DOWN,
            if flag, increment count.
              if count > 200, enable Blink3.
          else  // button is UP
            clear flag, clear counter, state = BUTTON_UP_1

    // Wait for button to be released for 30ms.
    BUTTON_UP_1:
          if buttonState is DOWN,      // due to switch bounce.
            clear counter,
            state = BUTTON_UP_1
          else  // button is UP
            increment counter.
          if counter > 3,
            state = IDLE.
