Log Notes for developing a TWI Register Slave I2C driver

ref1: DN_twiRegSlave.txt
ref2: megaAVR0-series-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40002015B.pdf

Target: megaAVR 0-series devices.


This I2C interface uses a register file system instead of a FIFO so that it more 
closely matches the operation of I2C slave hardware devices.
