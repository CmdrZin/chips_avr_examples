Target: megaAVR 0-series devices.

There are several serial utility module discussed here.
serialPoll	- Simplest serial support using polling and blocking calls.
serialFile	- Single message Send/Receive using interrupts and a message array.
serial	- Standard FIFO based interrupt driven serial module.

For PC host through debugger: USART3 (PB0:Tx,PB1:Rx)
for Arduino and other direct connections: USART0 (PA0:Tx, PA1:Rx)
System clock: 20 MHz		Baud: 9600 8N1

serialPoll
Use sample code from Section 3.[4]
Add some comments and adjustments.
(see serialPoll.c,.h)
