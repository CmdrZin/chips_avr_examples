Design Notes for Serial Send/Recieve drivers

Target: megaAVR 0-series devices.

ref1: DM320115-ATmega4809 Curiosity Nano Evaluation kit uses USART3 (PB0:Tx,PB1:Rx)

There are several serial utility module discussed here.
serialPoll	- Simplest serial support using polling and blocking calls.
serialFile	- Single message Send/Receive using interrupts and a message array.
serial	- Standard FIFO based interrupt driven serial module.

serialPoll
Features
Simple UART interface.

API Functions
void USART0_init(uint16_t baud);
	Initialize hardware and set baud rate.
void USART0_send_char(char c);
	Load c into transmit register. Block is register is not empty.
char USART0_recvChar();
	Return byte from receive register. Block is register is empty.
bool USART0_isChar();
	Return true if receive register is not empty.

serialFile
Features
Interrupt controlled UART interface.
Designed for ASCII character messages using '\n' termination.
Simplified message handling with one input array and one output array.
Message size detection.
Converts received message into a NULL terminated string.
Accepts NULL terminated string as message to send.

Additional API Functions
void twiRegSlaveInit(uint8_t adrs,
				uint8_t* rxRegFile, uint8_t rxRegFileSize,

serial
Features
Interrupt controlled UART interface.
16 byte send and 16 byte receive FIFOs.
Data available detection.
Blocking send(char) function if output FIFO is full.

API Functions
void twiRegSlaveInit(uint8_t adrs,
				uint8_t* rxRegFile, uint8_t rxRegFileSize,
