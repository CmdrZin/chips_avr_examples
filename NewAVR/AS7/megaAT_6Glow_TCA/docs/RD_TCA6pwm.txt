Reference Design Notes for a 6 PWM signal gererator using TCA in Split Mode

Target: megaAVR 0-series devices.

General requirements for a PWM signal generator.

Select a Period: 2.48 ms. This is the time it takes an 8-bit counter will overflow.

Resolution: 8 us. 

Pulse width can vary from 0.008ms (0) to 2.4 ms (255)

Most PWM systems start with the output pin HIGH and use a compare register to set 
it back LOW.

This project is a trimmed down version of the megaAT_6Servo_TCA.
