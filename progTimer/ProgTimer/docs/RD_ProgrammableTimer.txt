eZ430-Chronos Wrist Module from Texas Instruments - $58.00

IDEA: Add sense line to detect USB power and disable Sleep if connected.

Reference Design for Programmable Timer board

ref1: The Function List.docx

Target: ATmega328PA-AU (TQFP-32), 1 MHz, 9600 baud.
Power-Save 1MHz 3v ~0.002ma -> >10 yrs with 2032 (240mAh).
2032/2025 20mm coin cell 3V or
 USB FTDI (3.3V or 5.0V) for development.
 ONLY use 3.3v if battery is installed.

Normally in POWER_SAVE mode (0.002ma). Wake-up on Timeout (8s).
RS232 COM Port (FTDI/USB) 4800 8N1 no handshake (but available).

Two LEDs (RED and GREEN).
Two Push Button Switches [(A)ck & (S)nooze].
Buzzer (4kHz) with mute switch.

Use IsoTime format:	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (19 char)
	2013-03-23 01:03:52

Sleeps for 8 seconds, wakes for 2 to check for comm, extends to 10 seconds if
comm detected.

COMMANDS
'L'	Load list item into RAM. Index: 0-249 (0x00-0xFA)
	L <Index> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SN
Example: (21 bytes) Store 2013-03-23 01:03:50 with Note 2 at index 30.
'L' 1E '2' '0' '1' '3' '-' '0' '3' '-' '2' '3' ' ' '0' '1' ':' '0' '3' ':' '5' '2'
Returns 'O' 'K' 0D if accepted or '?' 0D if not.
Converts ASCII into time_t (4 bytes) as list entry.
NOTE: The 1s place of seconds is used to select the tone to be played 0-9.

'R'	Read event list. Returns the event list. NN:Number of entries then 
IsoTime ASCII entries seperated by CR (13).
	NN (19 bytes) CR (19 bytes) CR ...

'S'	Set time of day (20 bytes)(see 'L' command)
	S YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Returns 'O' 'K' 0D if accepted or '?' 0D if not.

'T'	Get time of day.
Returns YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 0D or '?' 0D

'C'	Enter Self Check mode

'D'	Dump EEPROM data
Reads out Tags and Time in ASCII formatted text.
<tag> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
<tag>
	1	Normal ACK on event. Event time.
	2	Snooze activated. Event time. Final ACK time.
	3	No Action taken within 30 min. Event time.

'E'	Erase EEPROM
	Zeros EEPROM data.

Tones
0 - Two 250ms 4kHz tones 500ms apart
1 - One 250ma 4kHz tone
2
3
4
5 - Tune (6 notes)
6
7
8
9 - Tune (5 notes)

Self-Check[1]
Hold down BOTH buttons until both LEDs flash On and Off then release the 
buttons.
When beeper sounds and the RED LED starts flashing, press either button to 
stop the beeps and stop the flashing. This is the acknowlege operation.
Pre-Use condition Self-Check Mode
Red - Green LEDs alternate flash every eight seconds when timer wakes up.
Press the 'A' button to acknowledge and then only the Green LED wil blink 
each 8 seconds and the event trigger process will be enabled.
NOTE: If this is done after the first event has been passed, that event 
will trigger on the next wake-up. Any other events that have pass times 
will also trigger each wake-up until all past events have been serviced.

Mute Switch
The Mute switch is a mechanical switch that disconnects the beeper. The device 
does not know what position the switch is in.

Event Signals[1]
1. Seconds = S0
Short signal (light and sound) repeated every 2 seconds for 1 minute until 
actions.
	Action #1: Snooze button (closest to mute switch) pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time, time snooze button was pressed, and action 
		tag into EEPROM.
		Set temperary event to trigger in 10 minutes.
		Second and third Snoozes use the original Event time.
		Action #1 can be repeated up to three times.

	Action #2: Off (acknowlege) button (closest to green LED) is pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time, time Off button was pressed, and action tag 
		into EEPROM.
		Play acknowlege tune.

	No Action: If 1 minute time out and no button pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time and action tag into EEPROM.
		Set temperary event to trigger in 10 minutes.
		No Action can occur up to three times, then Event will be removed.

2. Seconds = S9
Long signal (light + sound; different tone that repeated every 2 seconds for 
1 minute until actions.
	Action #1: Snooze button (closest to mute switch) pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time, time snooze button was pressed, and action 
		tag into EEPROM.
		Set temperary event to trigger in 10 minutes.
		Second and third Snoozes use the original Event time.
		Action #1 can be repeated up to three times.

	Action #2: Off (acknowlege) button (closest to green LED) is pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time, time Off button was pressed, and action tag 
		into EEPROM.
		Play acknowlege tune.

	No Action: If 1 minute time out and no button pressed.
		Turn OFF beep and RED LED.
		Store Event Time and action tag into EEPROM.
		Set temperary event to trigger in 10 minutes.
		No Action can occur up to three times, then Event will be removed.

NOTE: Beeps and Tunes can be selected by the ones digit of the seconds value.
The Event TAG value will be the same as the ones digit. So there can be ten 
different beeps/tunes for different Events.

If the unit is in Snooze and the Off button is presses while it is awake 
(happens for 2 second ever 8 second with a Green LED flash), then the the 
Action #2 sequence will take place.
